# 🚀 AI Agent Team Builder: A Flexible Multi-Agent Platform

Ever wished you could build a custom team of AI specialists, perfectly tailored to your exact needs? Forget rigid, pre-built systems. This is your personal **AI Agent Foundry**—a flexible, zero-dependency platform for designing, testing, and running sophisticated multi-agent workflows, all from a single HTML file.

The true power here isn't just in having an AI team; it's in your ability to be the architect of that team.

### 🛠️ Your Team, Your Rules: Ultimate Flexibility

This platform is designed from the ground up to be a sandbox for your imagination. You have complete control over the structure and behavior of your AI crew.

* **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Custom Team Composition**: You are the manager! The settings panel allows you to add entirely new agent roles with unique responsibilities or remove any you don't need. Your team can be as large or small as the task demands.
* **🧠 Total Prompt Control**: Rewrite the playbook for any agent. The entire system prompt for every single role is yours to modify, giving you granular control over their personality, goals, and expertise.
* **🤖 Mix & Match Models**: You can assign different Gemini models to different agents. Want a fast, lightweight model for a simple tasking agent but a powerful, nuanced one for your final analyst? Go for it.
* **🔄 Control the Pace**: Dictate the collaboration's intensity by specifying the maximum number of rounds. Let them work longer on complex problems or get quick results for straightforward tasks.
* **🎨 Light & Dark Themes**: A simple toggle lets you switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode for your comfort.

### 🚀 Example Setup: The Default Problem-Solvers

To get you started, the platform comes pre-configured with a versatile team of six agents. Think of this as your starter pack—a powerful, general-purpose team that is ready to go but is also fully customizable.

* **👑 The Leader**: The strategist who creates and refines the game plan.
* **🔎 The Researcher**: The information-gatherer who dives deep for data.
* **📊 The Analyst**: The interpreter who assesses the situation and finds patterns.
* **🧩 The Synthesizer**: The unifier who consolidates progress after each round.
